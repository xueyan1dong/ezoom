<a name="overview"><h4>Overview</h4></a>
ezOMM is an Online Manufacturing Management System. It helps manufacturers to manage manufacturing related activities,
in terms of collecting, storing, and analyzing data, in place of human intelligence, but with greater accuracy and efficiency.
<br/><br/>
To use the system, type in your username and password at the login screen. Once log in, you will see a screen that looks like
the following image:
<br/>
<img src="\Images\manual_overview.jpg" height="400px" weight="600px"></img><br/> <br/>

In the upper screen, there is a dark blue horizontal menu bar. The bar contains links to the three ezOMM modules respectively, 
as well as a link for contacting AmberSoft, LLC and a link for invoking this manual. On the left side, below the horizontal menu bar,
there is also a vertical menu pane. This pane contains submenu links belonging to the module that user went in. These links lead
to particular user interfaces for collecting data, tracking products, or presenting reports. User interfaces are presented in content area on the right
side of the vertial menu pane and below the horizontal menu bar<br/><br/> 

There are three modules in ezOMM: Configuration, Tracking, and Report. <br/><br/>

Configuration module is for recording resources necessary for running a manufacturing business into ezOMM, 
so that further management actions can be done through ezOMM. For details on how to use this module, see 
<a href="#configuration">How to Use Configuration Module</a>.<br /> <br/>

Tracking module is for tracing the movement of products from start to finish along their manufacturing workflow,
 and also collect real-time data for analytical and flow control purpose. For more details on how to use Tracking module, see
<a href="#tracking">How to Use Tracking Module</a>.<br/>
<br />
Report module utilizes all data available in ezOMM and presents a variety of reports for business purposes. For detail information
about the reports provided in this module, please go to <a href="#report">How to Use Report Module</a>.<br/><br/>

To access each module, click on the
link with the same name in the horizontal menu bar. The submenu belongs to the clicked module
appears in the vertical menu pane on the left side of the screen. The main page for the module also appears
in content area.<br/><br/>
To assure security, if an user hasn't been actively using the system for 30 minutes after logging in, the system will automatically
log the user out.

<a name ="configuration"><h4>How to Use Configuration Module</h4></a>
Configuration Module consists of 16 forms (so far) for recording resource information related to
manufacturing activities. Once entered Configuration module, User can access these forms through the links 
on the left vertical menu pane.<br/><br/>
 Most forms have two elements on the form: an "Insert" button on top of the
content area for inserting new record and a grid showing current existing records. <br/><br/>
If user clicks the "Insert" button, a new window containing input fields pops up, while
the existing window darkens. Fill in the input fields for new record and click "Submit" link on the popup window will insert a new
record into ezOMM database and also closes the popup window. User can also click "Cancel" link on the popup to dismiss the popup window.
<br/><br/>
In the grid, there is usually a delete link and an edit link at the front of each row. click on the "delete" link deletes the record 
(deactivate an employee in Employee form) from ezOMM. Click on the "edit" link brings up a popup window for editing the record.
This popup window works the same way as the popup window for inserting a new record.

Details about each form:<br/><br/>
<i>Employee</i><br/>
Use employee configuration form to insert or modify an employee record. Any user of ezOMM must have an account in ezOMM. The employee information is very important,
because tracking module needs this information to track and control access to manufacturing workflows and steps.<br />
Each employee has a role. Role represents the privilege for using ezOMM features. For example, employees who have "Admin" role can
access all features in ezOMM, while employees with "QA" role do not have access to Configuration module.
<br /><br/>
<i>Uom</i><br/>
Uom configuration form is for recording Unit of Measure information. The UoM will be referred in product configuration,
material configuration, inventory configuration, and sales configuration forms. Thus, unit of measures should be recorded using
this form early during configuration process.
<br /><br/>
<i>Uom Conversion</i><br/>
Uom Conversion form is for storing the conversion information between Unit of Measures. In the form, select an UoM from the dropdown box
on top of the form as the source Uom, then click "Insert" button to add a destination Uom, and type in its conversion ratio. For example, for
conversion 1m=10cm, select meter from the dropdown box, click "Insert" button, to show the Insertion Popup form
 and select cm in the TO_ID dropdown box, type in 10 in the ratio textbox. Click "Submit" link on the popup form. You can see the
new conversion appears in the grid on main form. The Uom Conversion form can also be accessed through the links in "Num of Conversions" column
of UoM configuration form. Click on a link in Uom form leads to Uom Conversion form with "From" uom selected.
<br /><br/>
<i>Product</i><br/>
Product configuration form records product definition information, but not actual product counts. <br />
In the form, "Lot Size" means the volume can be produced in one batch through a workflow. "LifeSpan" is the longivity or warranty time
that the product can be used before it expires.<br /><br />
<i>Product vs. Workflow</i><br/>
Product Workflow association form associate valid workflows to products. <br />
Each product can have one to multiple workflows availabe for producing the product. This form states the relationship by
associating workflows to product accordingly. The form can also be accessed in Product configuration form through the links
in "Num Workflow(s)" column of the grid.<br /><br />
<br /><br/>
<i>Material</i><br/>
Similar to product configuration, material configuration form stores the definition of materials purchased from suppliers,
but not actual material counts. Material definition information will be referred when constructing manufacturing
workflows.<br /><br />
<i>Inventory</i><br/>
Inventory table holds records of actual product and material counts.<br />
Once a product is finally completed, it is shipped into warehouse and also inserted into inventory table in ezOMM. Also
after a purchased material arrives warehouse, it is also inserted into inventory table.<br />
<br /><br/>
<i>Step</i><br/>
Step is an indivisible task within a workflow. A workflow consists of one to many steps. Different workflows may contain the
same step. <br />
Step configuration form is used to record steps into ezOMM. Information needed for defining a step are: step name, step type,
equipment, employee usage, employee or group, recipe, min time, max time, description, comment and parameters (1~10). <br />
Among them, only "step name" and "step type" are required. Step Type gives ezOMM clue on how to execute the step. The available step types are
given by Ambersoft, LLC based on customer requirements. Please see <a href="#steptype"> Explanation of Step Types</a> 
for more detail about step types. <br />
"Equipment" is the equipment the step will use. It is optional, for some steps do not need any equipment<br />
"Employee Usage" and "Employee Or Group" fields together define the access to a step. If "Employee Usage" is set to "Employee Group"
then the selected group from "Employee Or Group" dropdown box will have the previlidge to operate this step. If "Employee Usage" is
set to "Employee", then only the selected employee from "Employee Or Group" can operate the step.<br />
"Recipe" contains the material list,  quantity, and sequence information of the materials used in the step. Recipe is configured separately
in Recipe configuration form. Only the steps with Step Type as "consume material" need to choose a recipe from the "Recipe" dropdown box.<br />
"Min Time" is the minimum time required for the step to finish. It is only applicable, if a step has to take a certain amount of time
to cure or finish. Leave it blank, if not applicable.<br />
"Max Time" is the maximum time that a step can take. It is applicable when a step needs to finish within a certain time.<br />
"Description" stores a descriptive text for the step.<br />
"Comment" is used for storing comments that is not appropriate for putting into description field.<br />
Parameters are used to store other information relating to the step. For example, if a step has type "call api", parameter 1 will have
the name of the api(application interface, e.g. another software program) and parameter 2 -10 can be used to store the ariguments of the api.<br />
