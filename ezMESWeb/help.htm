    to particular user interfaces for collecting data, tracking products, or presenting reports. User interfaces are presented in content area on the right
    side of the vertial menu pane and below the horizontal menu bar<br /><br />

    There are three modules in ezOOM: Configuration, Tracking, and Report. <br /><br />

    Configuration module is for recording resources necessary for running a manufacturing business into ezOOM,
    so that further management actions can be done through ezOOM. For details on how to use this module, see
    <a href="#configuration">How to Use Configuration Module</a>.<br /> <br />

    Tracking module is for tracing the movement of products from start to finish along their manufacturing workflow,
    and also collect real-time data for analytical and flow control purpose. For more details on how to use Tracking module, see
    <a href="#tracking">How to Use Tracking Module</a>.<br />
    <br />
    Report module utilizes all data available in ezOOM and presents a variety of reports for business purposes. For detail information
    about the reports provided in this module, please go to <a href="#report">How to Use Report Module</a>.<br /><br />

    To access each module, click on the
    link with the same name in the horizontal menu bar. The submenu belongs to the clicked module
    appears in the vertical menu pane on the left side of the screen. The main page for the module also appears
    in content area.<br /><br />

    <a href="#content">back to Top</a><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="configuration"><h4>How to Use Configuration Module</h4></a>
        Configuration Module consists of 16 forms (so far) for recording resource information related to
        manufacturing activities. Once entered Configuration module, User can access these forms through the links
        on the left vertical menu pane.<br /><br />
        Most forms have two elements on the form: an "Insert" button on top of the
        content area for inserting new record and a grid showing current existing records. <br /><br />
        If user clicks the "Insert" button, a new window containing input fields pops up, while
        the existing window darkens. Fill in the input fields for new record and click "Submit" link on the popup window will insert a new
        record into ezOOM database and also closes the popup window. User can also click "Cancel" link on the popup to dismiss the popup window.

        <img src="\Images\Configuration_Insert.PNG" height="400px" width="690px" weight="600px" />
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    In the grid, there is usually a delete link and an edit link at the front of each row. click on the "delete" link deletes the record
    (deactivate an employee in Employee form) from ezOOM. Click on the "edit" link brings up a popup window for editing the record.
    This popup window works the same way as the popup window for inserting a new record.


    Details about each form:<br /><br />
    <i>Employee</i><br />
    Use employee configuration form to insert or modify an employee record. Any user of ezOOM must have an account in ezOOM. The employee information is very important,
    because tracking module needs this information to track and control access to manufacturing workflows and steps.<br />
    Each employee has a role. Role represents the privilege for using ezOOM features. For example, employees who have "Admin" role can
    access all features in ezOOM, while employees with "QA" role do not have access to Configuration module.
    <br /><br />
    <i>Customers / Suppliers</i><br />
    The form of Customers / Suppliers is for recording the information for both Customers and Suppliers. The information includes name, type that specifies a customer type or a supplier type, internal contact person, company telephone number, number of documents,
    address, secondary address(Address2), first contact person, second contact person, workphone of first contact person, cellphone of first contact, email of first contact, workphone of second contact person, cellphone of second contact,
    email of second contact person, date of first list, if the customer/supplier is currently active and comment. New records can be added. Click on the Insert button and input all necessary information in the popup window.
    Click on Submit to add the record to database. Click on Cancel will discard all previous inputs and return back to Customers / Suppliers form.

    path to successfully submit your changes. Click on the Submit button to submit the desired information or cancel all changes by Clicking on the Cancel button.
    You can browse the document list of a customer by selecting the name of the customer from the Client Dropdown list. The Document table will only display the information for the selected customer.
    <br /><br />
    <i>Uom</i><br />
    Uom configuration form is for recording Unit of Measure information. The UoM will be referred in product configuration,
    material configuration, inventory configuration, and sales configuration forms. Thus, unit of measures should be recorded using
    this form early during configuration process.
    <br /><br />
    <i>Uom Conversion</i><br />
    Uom Conversion form is for storing the conversion information between Unit of Measures. In the form, select an UoM from the dropdown box
    on top of the form as the source Uom, then click "Insert" button to add a destination Uom, and type in its conversion ratio. For example, for
    conversion 1m=10cm, select meter from the dropdown box, click "Insert" button, to show the Insertion Popup form
    and select cm in the TO_ID dropdown box, type in 10 in the ratio textbox. Click "Submit" link on the popup form. You can see the
    new conversion appears in the grid on main form. The Uom Conversion form can also be accessed through the links in "Num of Conversions" column
    of UoM configuration form. Click on a link in Uom form leads to Uom Conversion form with "From" uom selected.
    <br /><br />
    <i>Product Group</i><br />
    ???
    <br /><br />
    <i>Product</i><br />
    Product configuration form records product definition information, but not actual product counts. <br />
    In the form, "Lot Size" means the volume can be produced in one batch through a workflow. "LifeSpan" is the longivity or warranty time
    that the product can be used before it expires.<br /><br />
    <i>Product vs. Workflow</i><br />
    Product Workflow association form associate valid workflows to products. <br />
    Each product can have one to multiple workflows availabe for producing the product. This form states the relationship by
    associating workflows to product accordingly. The form can also be accessed in Product configuration form through the links
    in "Num Workflow(s)" column of the grid.
    <br /><br />
    <i>Item / Part Group</i><br />

    correct part# and click on the Search button. Only the records that met the searching criteria will be shown in the Item/Part table.
    <br /><br />
    <i>Material</i><br />
    Similar to product configuration, material configuration form stores the definition of materials purchased from suppliers,
    but not actual material counts. Material definition information will be referred when constructing manufacturing
    workflows.<br /><br />

    <i>Step</i><br />
    Step is an indivisible task within a workflow. A workflow consists of one to many steps. Different workflows may contain the
    same step. <br />
    Step configuration form is used to record steps into ezOOM. Information needed for defining a step are: step name, step type,
    equipment, employee usage, employee or group, recipe, min time, max time, description, comment and parameters (1~10). <br />
    Among them, only "step name" and "step type" are required. Step Type gives ezOOM clue on how to execute the step. The available step types are
    given by IT Helps based on customer requirements. Please see <a href="#steptype"> Explanation of Step Types</a>
    for more detail about step types. <br />

    "Equipment" is the equipment the step will use. It is optional, for some steps do not need any equipment<br />
    "Employee Usage" and "Employee Or Group" fields together define the access to a step. If "Employee Usage" is set to "Employee Group"
    then the selected group from "Employee Or Group" dropdown box will have the previlidge to operate this step. If "Employee Usage" is
    set to "Employee", then only the selected employee from "Employee Or Group" can operate the step.<br />
    "Recipe" contains the material list,  quantity, and sequence information of the materials used in the step. Recipe is configured separately
    in Recipe configuration form. Only the steps with Step Type as "consume material" need to choose a recipe from the "Recipe" dropdown box.<br />
    "Min Time" is the minimum time required for the step to finish. It is only applicable, if a step has to take a certain amount of time
    to cure or finish. Leave it blank, if not applicable.<br />
    "Max Time" is the maximum time that a step can take. It is applicable when a step needs to finish within a certain time.<br />
    "Description" stores a descriptive text for the step.<br />
    "Comment" is used for storing comments that is not appropriate for putting into description field.<br />
    Parameters are used to store other information relating to the step. For example, if a step has type "call api", parameter 1 will have
    the name of the api(application interface, e.g. another software program) and parameter 2 -10 can be used to store the ariguments of the api.<br />
    <br />

    <a name="steptype"><i>Explanation of Step Types</i></a><br />
    "consume material" -- this type of step can be used for steps that needed a recipe. A recipe includes bill of material that the step needs, <br />
    along with the virbal or graphical instructions on how to perform the task. Recipe can be created and maintained in Recipe Configuration Page.  <br />
    The interface for this step type will show the content of the recipe, and allow user to deduct consumption of materials from inventory. The interface <br />
    will also show two buttons for printing package label and package list, if the first parameter in the step configuration is assigned the text value of <br />
    "print packing docs". <br />
    "ship to location" -- this stype is used for tracking shipment of batch from one location to another. In this step, user will be able to assign batch a<br />
    new location. More over, if the first parameter in the step configuration is assigned the text value of "log tracking num", user will be able to record <br />
    tracking number when performing this step. <br />
    <br /><br />

    <i>Recipe</i><br />
    Recipe configuration Module lists all defined recipes in ezOOM system that the users can refer to. By clicking on the gray button as shown in the picture below, with recipe's name on it, the user
    can check each recipe's general information as well as the information of parts used in the recipe. A defined recipe can be edited or deleted for different purposes. Its general information and parts information can be updated.
    New parts can be added and old parts can be deleted.<br />
